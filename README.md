# Shop Management Software
Java program for managing a shop.

Developed a custom GUI shop management software in Java Swing as part of the Human Machine Interaction course,
collaborating with a fellow student to design and implement the program. 
The software enables shopkeepers to efficiently manage their products and clients,
with features including the ability to add or remove products, track
inventory, and generate sales reports. Our project was well-received
by our course instructor, complete with a comprehensive manual in Greek on Wiki section.
